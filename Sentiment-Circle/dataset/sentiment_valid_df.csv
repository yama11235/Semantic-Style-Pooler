"Checked my EBT balance yesterday. ""You will not be receiving benefits for February."". I wonder when the riots are going to start.",surprise
"I am so thrilled that you broke through that constraining ceiling, or that ""tunnel vision"".",surprise
I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.,surprise
Oh wow. Didn’t realize it was that broad.,surprise
Right? I’ve never heard of it being made with French dressing.,surprise
Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.,surprise
"Oh, he isn't dead, [NAME] ",surprise
It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.,surprise
Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought,surprise
This was literally me!,surprise
Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..,surprise
"Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I’ve read in years that didn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. ",surprise
This is like that SNL sketch. EDIT: For anyone wondering what I’m talking about.,surprise
It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol.,surprise
"Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now [NAME] damn, they using a young baseline. Like 1951 or something. Were warmer than just 1 C",surprise
"I've been into cuckolding for many years, and I'm wondering the same thing! ",surprise
"Suddenly, I was awake.",surprise

Hey Man! Your house is on fire! All you gotta do is look just turn around and look!,surprise

Oh the irony in the title,surprise
"730,000 readers and only 6 posts in a week? Wow...",surprise
"I’m really late here, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you.",surprise
[NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.,surprise
He was dead through the whole movie. Oh wait,surprise
omg you like totally caught me!!! i'm just a silly social media girl named [NAME],surprise
WHAT A TWIST!!,surprise
This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.,surprise
It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.,surprise
I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!,surprise
Can you imagine being taken to court over a flushing loo? I can’t believe the courts are even entertaining this.,surprise
I don’t know about shatting myself but I would have been _shocked_ for sure.,surprise
"Oh boy, leprosy!",surprise
Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.,surprise
I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.,surprise
"Wow, that's cool!",surprise
Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions,surprise
I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.,surprise
"Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha",surprise
There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread—thanks for the edit all the same.,surprise
OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.,surprise
I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.,surprise
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...,surprise
I can't believe he used the N-word.,surprise
Oh wow I genuinely thought this was funny can’t believe you copped it so hard,surprise
"I didn’t know [NAME] was a boxer, he can take a punch though!",surprise
"The dress was trailer trash appropriate. Did he just run out of money for a good dress? I mean, $300 BLACK UNDIES.",surprise
No way! First I’m hearing about this,surprise
"Oh no, I'm getting flashbacks",surprise
"Wow, not exactly a complimentary typo. ",surprise
I wonder why! :/,surprise
? ur slide is right stick,surprise
"You too! (FYI I accidentally initially replied in a new comment, in case you didn’t see my other reply)",surprise
I'm thinking I'd be wondering how I got my hands on a time machine.,surprise
Hmm I wonder why the bot copy text LAOP says is in NY when the original post says LAOP says he's in TX,surprise
Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME],surprise
Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.,surprise
Our o-line was great outside of 2 games this year. My [NAME] did you even watch or pay attention to this team this year?,surprise
yes!! i was like oh my god. oh my [NAME]. it’s gone. the weight’s GONE. i’m FREE!,surprise
Wow! I can save $15 and buy this used version?!?!? How wonderful!,surprise
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.,surprise
What? You don't know what punishment is?,surprise
"Color me surprised. Take your ""free"" care and like it, peon!",surprise
The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j,surprise
I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.,surprise
Probably. I am surprised Reddit doesn't just purge all right leaning subs.,surprise
Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.,surprise
"Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion.",surprise
I still can't believe I used to watch [NAME] videos,surprise
"Wow, that's clunky.",surprise
Blatant manipulation. Wow!! Who do we report that to?,surprise
Omg if WOW sue’s her then my depression would be cured and I’ll have my jush,surprise
Flashbacks to hallucinations? Whoa,surprise
This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.,surprise
"Pretty stock standard winger. Depth at a good club, regular starter at a bad club kinda deal",surprise
Omg l live for [NAME] stirring the pot!!,surprise
Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!,surprise
"I can't believe this team beat Winnipeg last week, handily too. That effort hasn't been there since. ",surprise
I’m really glad [NAME] wasn’t [NAME],relief
Thank god. The capitalists are the most virtuous among us.,relief
"At the very least, I’m glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. ",relief
"I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.",relief
"Finally, we can put [NAME] down at the bottom like the EXP thief deserves.",relief
